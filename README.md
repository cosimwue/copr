# COPR – Simulating Conflicts

This easy-to-use application enables its users to simulate a military conflict which is mathematically modelled, for example, by [Lanchester’s Square Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanchester%27s_laws), calculating the relative strengths of both forces.

**COPR** stands for **C**onflict **O**peration **P**lan **R**esponse, an homage to [WOPR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRsycWRQrc8), the supercomputer in John Badham’s film WarGames, programmed to continuously run war simulations and learn over time.
